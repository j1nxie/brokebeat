# brokebeat

a project inspired by [Brokenithm](https://github.com/esterTion/Brokenithm-iOS), giving you
the means to play jubeat without using a keyboard or a proper controller.

**NOTICE:** heavily in development, currently not functioning other than displaying a [slidershim](https://github.com/4yn/slidershim)-like
web interface!
